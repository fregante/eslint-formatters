# eslint-formatter-visualstudio

> ESLintâ€™s official `visualstudio` formatter, unofficially published as a standalone module

You can see the [output example on eslint.org](https://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/formatters/#visualstudio).

This package has been extracted from [ESLintâ€™s repository](https://github.com/eslint/eslint/tree/master/lib/cli-engine/formatters) by @fregante so you can use it independently of ESLint.

**Important:** If you're using ESLint, you do not need this package, the formatter is built into ESLint.

**Note for ESLintâ€™s maintainers:** Open an issue on [fregante/eslint-formatters](https://github.com/fregante/eslint-formatters) if you'd like to publish these packages yourself as part of a monorepo. I'll gladly pass the npm names to you. Much ðŸ’š
